 Municipal Services Application

 Description
The Municipal Services Application aims to provide citizens with a comprehensive platform to access local services efficiently. The application is divided into two main parts:

 Part 1
In Part 1, the focus was on developing the core functionalities of the application, including the ability to report issues related to municipal services. This feature allows users to provide feedback, report problems, and attach relevant documents to support their claims. A simple and intuitive user interface was designed to enhance user experience and ensure ease of use.

 Part 2
Part 2 builds upon the foundation set in Part 1, introducing a Local Events and Announcements feature. This part incorporates advanced data structures and algorithms to enhance the application’s performance and usability. Key features include:
- **Local Events and Announcements**: Users can view upcoming events and announcements in an aesthetically pleasing manner. 
- **Search Functionality**: A robust search feature enables users to efficiently find events based on categories and dates.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Utilization of stacks, queues, and sorted dictionaries to optimize event organization and retrieval.
- **Recommendation Feature**: Analyzes user search patterns to suggest related events, enhancing user engagement and discovery.
